## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

By building this project I practiced my CSS and JavaScript skills, specifically SCSS and DOM manipulation using Vanilla JS.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to learn one of the popular JavaScript frontend frameworks/libraries, such as Vue or React.
